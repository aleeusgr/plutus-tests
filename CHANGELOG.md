The last several weeks were rather intense and the pain in the back is crazy, I even lost my sleep somehow.
What needs to be done?
This repo covers a good chunk of work to do: we have the green light.

The contract in this repo is Level 1 certification ready. 
What does it mean? 
I need to find a name for the next step. 
How do I name my pull request?
For this I formulate a testing oracle. 
LOOK AT THE CODE!

`cabal run` starts PAB.
`cabal test` runs some tests. 

PAB does not have any libraries?
